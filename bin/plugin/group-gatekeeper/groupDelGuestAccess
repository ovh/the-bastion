Remove a specific group server access from an account

Usage: --osh SCRIPT_NAME --group GROUP --account ACCOUNT [OPTIONS]

  --account ACCOUNT        Bastion account remove the guest access from
  --group GROUP            Specify which group to remove the guest access to ACCOUNT from
  --host HOST|IP|NET/CIDR  Host(s) to remove access from, either a HOST which will be resolved to an IP immediately,
                             or an IP, or a whole network using the NET/CIDR notation
  --user USER|PATTERN|*    Specify which remote user was allowed to connect as.
                             Globbing characters '*' and '?' are supported, so you can specify a pattern
                             that will be matched against the actual remote user name.
                             If any user was allowed, use '--user *' (you might need to escape '*' from your shell)
  --port PORT|*            Remote port that was allowed to connect to
                             If any user was allowed, use '--port *' (you might need to escape '*' from your shell)
  --protocol PROTO         Specify that a special protocol was allowed for this HOST:PORT tuple, note that you
                              must not specify --user in that case. However, for this protocol to be usable under a given
                              remote user, access to the USER@HOST:PORT tuple must also be allowed.
                              PROTO must be one of:
                              scpup    allow SCP upload, you--bastion-->server
                              scpdown  allow SCP download, you<--bastion--server
                              sftp     allow usage of the SFTP subsystem, through the bastion
                              rsync    allow usage of rsync, through the bastion

This command removes, from an existing bastion account, access to a given server, using the
egress keys of the group. The list of such servers is given by ``groupListGuestAccesses``

If you want to remove member access from an account to all the present and future servers
of the group, using the group key, please use ``groupDelMember`` instead.

If you want to remove access from an account from a group server but using their personal bastion
key instead of the group key, please use ``accountDelPersonalAccess`` instead.

This command is the opposite of ``groupAddGuestAccess``.
