Show the list of servers you have access to

Usage: --osh SCRIPT_NAME [--hide-groups] [--reverse-dns]

  --hide-groups      Don't show the machines you have access to through group rights.
                       In other words, list only your personal accesses.
  --reverse-dns      Attempt to resolve the reverse hostnames (SLOW!)
  --include PATTERN  Only include accesses matching the given PATTERN (see below)
                        This option can be used multiple times to refine results
  --exclude PATTERN  Omit accesses matching the given PATTERN (see below)
                        This option can be used multiple times.
                        Note that --exclude takes precedence over --include

**Note:** PATTERN supports the ``*`` and ``?`` wildcards.
If PATTERN is a simple string without wildcards, then names containing this string will be considered.
The matching is done on the text output of the command.
