# Config for the HTTP Proxy of The Bastion.
# This is a JSON file, its syntax must be valid at all times. To verify:
# => grep -v ^# /etc/bastion/osh-http-proxy.conf|python -mjson.tool>/dev/null && echo OK
#
# If you're on a production bastion you can verify it can properly load its configuration:
# => perl -I/opt/bastion/lib/perl -MOVH::Bastion -e 'die OVH::Bastion::load_configuration_file(file => "/etc/bastion/osh-http-proxy.conf")'

# port (int)
#    VALUE: 1 to 65535
#     DESC: port to listen to. you can set < 1024, in which case privileges will be dropped after binding,
#           but please ensure your systemd unit file starts the daemon as root in that case

# ciphers (string)

#     DESC: the ordered list the TLS server ciphers, in openssl classic format. Use `openssl ciphers' to see what your system supports,
#           an empty list leaves the choice to your openssl libraries default values (system-dependent)
#  EXAMPLE: "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256"

#  DEFAULT: true
"log_request_response": true,
#
# log_request_response_max_size (int)
#    VALUE: 0 to 2^30 (1 GiB)
#     DESC: this option only applies when `log_request_response` is true (see above). When set to zero, the complete response will be logged in the account's home log directory, including the body, regardless of its size. If set to a positive integer, the query response will only be partially logged, with full status and headers but the body only up to the specified size. This is a way to avoid turning off request response logging completely on very busy bastions, by ensuring logs growth don't get out of hand, as some responses to queries can take megabytes, with possibly limited added value to traceability.
