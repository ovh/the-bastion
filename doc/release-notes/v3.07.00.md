# :bulb: Highlights

The two main features of this version are:

- The support of the Duo PAM auth as MFA (see #249 for more information)
- A new access setup option, `--force-password`, which is similar to `--force-key`, but to be used when a specific egress password is required instead of a specific SSH key for a given host. Note that this doesn't work for guest group accesses yet, which will be implemented in a future version. More information can be found in #256.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
