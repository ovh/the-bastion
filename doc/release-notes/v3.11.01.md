# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

This is a hotfix release, the only fixed issue is a display issue introduced in `v3.11.00` in the `groupInfo` command, which would always display an empty list for the gatekeepers of a group, along with "?" instead of the number of accesses for each guest.
Note that the JSON output was correct, only the human-readable output of `groupInfo` was impacted.
