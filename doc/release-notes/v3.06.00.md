# :bulb: Highlights
 
The main new feature of this version is the `--pubkey-auth-optional` option to `accountModify`, to tag some accounts so that they don't need a public key for the ingress connection, but only a password (and maybe a TOTP). Of course, as passwords are always less secure than public-key authentication, please only use it for specific use cases you may have. #237 for more details, along with the specific upgrade instructions (see below).

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
