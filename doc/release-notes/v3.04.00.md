# :bulb: Highlights

A lot of documentation landed in this version, such as [details about the access management](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/basics/access_management.html), [PIV keys support](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/piv.html), [SCP support](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/scp.html), [the HTTPS Proxy module](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/http_proxy.html). The reference of the [osh-http-proxy.conf](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/configuration/osh-http-proxy_conf.html) file has also been published.

The following operating systems are no longer supported, as they've been EOL for quite a while. The code may continue to work, but these are no longer part of the tests:
- Debian 8
- Ubuntu 14.04
- OpenSUSE 15.0/15.1

The following additional OSes major versions are now supported and part of the automated tests:
- OpenSUSE 15.3
