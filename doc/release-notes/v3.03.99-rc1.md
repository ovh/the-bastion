# :warning: This is a release candidate

As several important pull-requests have been merged, we're starting a **release candidate cycle**.
This pre-release which will be battle-tested in the field for a few days.

Note that release candidates, due to the higher-than-usual amount of changes they contain, are statistically more likely to have a few quirks or bugs. Please refrain to use this version in critical production systems, unless it contains either a feature you really need, or a bugfix you've been waiting for, which may outweigh the potential drawbacks of using a release candidate.

Prerequisites before this version goes stable:
- No regression or blocking bug is found within ~2 weeks
- A minimal documentation about the HTTP Proxy is published
