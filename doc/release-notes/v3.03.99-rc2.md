# :warning: This is a release candidate

Note that release candidates, due to the higher-than-usual amount of changes they contain, are statistically more likely to have a few quirks or bugs. Please refrain to use this version in critical production systems, unless it contains either a feature you really need, or a bugfix you've been waiting for, which may outweigh the potential drawbacks of using a release candidate.

This version will go stable in a few days if no regression is found.

# :bulb: Highlights

A lot of documentation landed in this version, such as [details about the access management](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/basics/access_management.html), [PIV keys support](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/piv.html), [SCP support](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/scp.html), [the HTTPS Proxy module](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/http_proxy.html). The reference of the [osh-http-proxy.conf](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/configuration/osh-http-proxy_conf.html) file has also been published.

The following operating systems are no longer supported, as they've been EOL for quite a while. The code may continue to work, but these are no longer part of the tests:
- Debian 8
- Ubuntu 14.04
- OpenSUSE 15.0/15.1

# :fast_forward: Upgrading

- General upgrade instructions: [How to upgrade](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/installation/upgrading.html)
- Specific upgrade instructions: *Only if you're upgrading from rc1*: the `allowUTF8` option in `bastion.conf` has been renamed to `fanciness`. This is no longer a bool, but an enum. Replace `true` by `full` and `false` by `none`.
