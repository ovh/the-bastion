# :bulb: Highlights

A new restricted command has been added: [assetForgetHostKey](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/assetForgetHostKey.html), which is the bastion-wide version of the [selfForgetHostKey](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/selfForgetHostKey.html) command. In other words, it removes a given asset's hostkey from all the bastion accounts' personal `known_hosts` file. This is particularely useful when a given asset is reinstalled or its IP is being reallocated, and you've left the bastion-wide default of `StrictHostKeyChecking` to 'ask': in that case, if this command is not used after the asset hostkeys have changed, each account will have to use [selfForgetHostKey](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/selfForgetHostKey.html) on their own, to tell the bastion that the previously known hostkey should be forgotten.

This new command makes it possible to sync the reinstallation of an asset with a bastion-wide reset of its hostkeys (e.g. using an automation account that will be granted the use of the [assetForgetHostKey](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/assetForgetHostKey.html) command), without requiring all the other accounts to do it on their own. On their next connection, the other accounts will just have to accept the new hostkey (if `StrictHostKeyChecking` is set to `ask`, which is the default), or the new hostkey will be auto-accepted in the absence of a known one (if `StrictHostKeyChecking` is set to `accept-new`).

A long-standing but has also been fixed with stalling downloads using `scp` (#486).
