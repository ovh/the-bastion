# :warning: This is a release candidate

Note that release candidates, due to the higher-than-usual amount of changes they contain, are statistically more likely to have a few quirks or bugs. Please refrain to use this version in critical production systems, unless it contains either a feature you really need, or a bugfix you've been waiting for, which may outweigh the potential drawbacks of using a release candidate.

This version will go stable in a few days if no regression is found.
