# :bulb: Highlights

The main change of this version is:

- A new system script, [osh-remove-empty-folders.sh](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/configuration/osh-remove-empty-folders_conf.html), called by cron and responsible for cleaning up the ``ttyrec/`` directory of users homes, which may contain a high amount of empty folders for busy users tonnecting to a lot of different servers, as we create one folder per destination IP.

An exhaustive list of changes can be found below.
