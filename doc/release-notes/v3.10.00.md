# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

Main changes from the previous version are:
- Two new restricted commands: `accountFreeze` and `accountUnfreeze,` to temporarily disable an account, in a reversible way.
- New options to the `accountInfo` commands: `--no-password-info` and `--no-output,` to get a speed boost when those informations are not needed by the caller

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
