# :bulb: Highlights

This release fixes a possibly problematic behavior introduced in `v3.13.00` when replacing `sqlite` logging of plugins output by `ttyrec` where the `scp` and `sftp` plugins, when downloading a file (from the remote server to the local machine through the bastion) would save the binary stream as part of the ttyrec file, possibly taking a lot of space when these plugins are often used.

Another, somehow niche, new feature is the support of so-called `type8` and `type9` hash types for egress passwords, mainly used by network devices. More information is available in the specific upgrade instructions link below.
