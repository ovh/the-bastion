# :bulb: Highlights

This release drops official support for Debian 10, whose LTS support has ended in June 2024.
We now support the new Debian 13 stable (Trixie), and as a side effect, compatibility with other untested Linux distributions
using OpenSSH >= 10.0 should also be better.

We took this opportunity to clean up compatibility code for long unsupported systems (such as NetBSD, OpenBSD), and enhance
support for FreeBSD, particularly (but not exclusively) on satellite cron scripts.

A few bugs were also squished: a more complete list of changes can be found below,
for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the [commit log](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/compare/v3.20.00...v3.21.00).
