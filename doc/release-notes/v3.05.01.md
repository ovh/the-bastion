# :bulb: Highlights

A few minor features appear in this revision, if you don't need these you might skip this update.

- It is now possible to sign the backups in addition to encryption

- The interactive mode now supports an ``mfa`` command, to proactively request an MFA challenge that will be valid for a configured amount of time. The ``--proactive-mfa`` parameter is the equivalent for non-interactive mode, e.g. to be used along with `--osh clush` or `--osh batch`

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
