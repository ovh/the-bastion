Changes:

- feat: transmit PIV enforcement status to remote realms, so that the remote policy can be enforced (#33)
- feat: add `groupGenerateEgressKey` and `groupDelEgressKey` (#135)
- feat: auto-add hostname as comment in `groupAddServer` and `selfAddPersonalAccesss` (side-note in #60)
- enh: `groupAddGuestAccess` now supports setting a comment (#17, #18)
- enh: `groupAddServer`: augment the returned JSON with the added server details
- enh: move unexpected-sudo messages from `security` to `code-warning` type
- enh: egress ssh key: compute an ID so that keys can be pointed to and deleted
- fix: `groupDelGuestAccess`: deleting a guest access returned an error on TTL-forced groups
- fix: groupSetRole(): pass sudo param to subfuncs to avoid a security warning
- fix: execute(): remove osh_warn on tainted params to avoid exposing arguments on coding error
- fix: `groupModify`: deny early if user is not an owner of the group
- enh: `groupInfo`: nicer message when no egress key exists
- enh: `install`: use in-place overwrite for sudoers files, the 3-seconds wait by default has been removed (and the `--no-wait` parameter is now a no-op)
- fix: `interactive`: omit inactivity message warning when set to 0 seconds
- a few other internal fixes here and there
