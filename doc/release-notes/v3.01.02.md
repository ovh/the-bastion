**Changelog:**
- feat: support CentOS 8.3
- fix: is_valid_remote_user: extend allowed size from 32 to 128
- doc: `bastions.conf.dist`: wrong options values in `accountMFAPolicy` comments
- chore: packages-check: remove unused packages

Now we're supporting (and automatically testing) the last 3 point releases of CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, to allow for a smoother upgrade path. Previously, we would only test the latest point release.
