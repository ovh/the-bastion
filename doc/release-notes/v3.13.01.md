# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

This minor release has only a few changes, mainly on the documentation and setup sides. Two new important documentation sections have appeared:

- The [JSON API](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/api.html) section, detailing how to integrate The Bastion in your automated workflows, and
- The [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/mfa.html) section, detailing several possible setups to harden your users accesses

The features documented above have been available since `v3.00.00`, so updating to this version is not required to use them.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
