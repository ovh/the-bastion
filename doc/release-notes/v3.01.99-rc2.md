This is a **release-candidate**.

As several important pull-requests have been merged, we're starting with rc series, which will be tested in the field for a few days. If no regression or blocking bug is found within ~2 weeks, the next v3.02.00 stable version will be released.

The following changes have been done since the previous rc:
- fix: re-introduce the ttyrecfile field (fixes #114)
- fix: logs: sql dbname was not properly passed through the update logs func (fixes #114)
- doc: upgrade: add a note about config normalization
