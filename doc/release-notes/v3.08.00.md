# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

The 2 main changes of this version are:

- System scripts are now using GnuPG 2.x instead of GnuPG 1.x. All supported OSes do support GnuPG 2.x. The 2.x series of GnuPG support more key algorithms (such as ECDSA and Ed25519), for both higher security and speed. Please refer to the specific upgrade instructions for more information.

- New restricted plugin `accountUnlock`, to unlock accounts locked by either `pam_tally`, `pam_tally2` or `pam_faillock`

Additionally, the supported list of operating systems has changed:

- Removed official support for OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 (EOL), older minor releases of CentOS 7.x and 8.x (EOL). No code has been removed that would break compatibility, but we removed these OSes from the automated tests suite, so the code may stop working in the future on these OSes for a root cause that we wouldn't be able to detect automatically.
- Added official support for Debian "Bullseye" 11, RockyLinux 8.x
 
Also note that since `v3.03.99-rc2`, the FreeBSD integration tests were not running properly, this has been fixed and the few non-passing tests since this version have also been resolved.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
