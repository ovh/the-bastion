# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

The change from the previous version is:

- The plugins output is now recorded using `ttyrec`, as the egress connections are, instead of being stored in `sqlite` format
within the home folder of the account. This helps avoiding the sqlite databases growing too much in size when
accounts are using `--osh` commands very intensively.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.

# :pushpin: Changes
