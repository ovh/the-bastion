# :bulb: Highlights

This release drops official support for Ubuntu 18.04. Consequently, we upped the minimum required version of Perl to v5.26 (released in 2017).

The main change is the support of arbitrary binary data passed through the HTTPS proxy, hence if you use it, restarting the daemon after the upgrade is important.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the [commit log](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/compare/v3.19.01...v3.20.00).
