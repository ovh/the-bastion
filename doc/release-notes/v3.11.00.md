# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

Main changes from the previous version are:
- `SFTP` passthrough is now supported, all the commands manipulating accesses have been modified accordingly, to add the ``--sftp`` option. More information can be found [in the documentation](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/sftp_scp.html).
- The `groupInfo` and `accountInfo` commands have been augmented with a new `--all` option, reserved for bastion auditors, to dump detailed data about all the groups or accounts, respectively. The amount of information to be dumped can be controlled with a series of `--with-*` and `--without-*` options, more information can be found in each command's own documentation ([groupInfo](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/open/groupInfo.html) and [accountInfo](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/accountInfo.html). Prefer the use of `accountInfo --all` instead of `accountList --audit`, as the latter will be deprecated soon.

Another change that should be noted is the removal of the implicit `--port-any` and `--user-any` to the `self(Add|Del)PersonalAccess` and `account(Add|Del)PersonalAccess` commands, when either `--user` or `--port` are omitted, to be consistent with `group(Add|Del)Server` which never had this behaviour. This always emitted a deprecation warning since the first publicly released version, encouraging the explicit use of `--user-any` and/or `--port-any` when this was desired. Now, omitting these options will simply return an error, as this has always been the case with `group(Add|Del)Server`.
