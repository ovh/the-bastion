# :bulb: Highlights

This release adds support for more than just ``GET`` and ``POST`` methods to the HTTPS Proxy, configurable through
[osh-http-proxy.conf](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/configuration/osh-http-proxy_conf.html#allowed-methods).

A new feature also adds some quality of life to users of :file:`/home`-encrypted bastions: the node status can now be
seen directly in the sshd banner, so that they know whether they need to use another node, see the
[Specific upgrade instructions](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/installation/upgrading.html#v3-23-00-2025-12-22)
on how to enable it on an already installed bastion.

We also get our usual round of fixes and enhancements, listed below.
for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the [commit log](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/compare/v3.22.00...v3.23.00).
