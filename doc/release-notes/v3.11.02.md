# :zap: Security

- No security fixes since previous release
- Oldest release with no known security issues: `v3.00.00` (first public version)

# :bulb: Highlights

Main changes from the previous version are:
- A new script `bin/admin/check_uid_gid_collisions.pl` has been added, to ease procedures such as [HA setup](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/installation/restoring_from_backup.html#ensuring-the-uids-gids-are-in-sync) and [backup restoration](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/installation/advanced.html#ensuring-the-uids-gids-are-in-sync). The documentation has been updated accordingly to reference the proper usage of this script at the right steps.
- We now support RockyLinux 9, OpenSUSE Leap 15.4. Debian 12 is also now part of the test workflows to ensure we support it as soon as it's officially released in the next few months.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the commit log.
