# :bulb: Highlights

This is a pre-release, so that the #461 change can be thoroughly tested before being promoted to a release.

This releases updates the supported OS list as follows:
- drop support for Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7
- add support for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and OpenSUSE Leap 15.6

This release adds support of wildcards (also called "shell-style globbing characters"), namely ``?`` and ``*``,
when using the ``--user`` option for plugins such as ``groupAddServer``, ``groupDelServer``, ``groupAddGuestAccess``,
``groupDelGuestAccess``, ``accountAddPersonalAccess``, ``accountDelPersonalAccess``, ``selfAddPersonalAccess``,
``selfDelPersonalAccess``. This implements #461.

We also enable the ``sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com`` KEX algorithm by default on shipped versions
of ``sshd_config`` and ``ssh_config``, read the specific upgrades instructions linked below if you're interested and this is not a new installation.
