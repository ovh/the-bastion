# :bulb: Highlights

This release adds the possibility to allow plain HTTP on the egress side of the bastion HTTPS proxy.

Of course, this feature is disabled by default, and you must allow it explicitely if your business constraints force you to. To this effect, you may specify the [allowed_egress_protocols](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/administration/configuration/osh-http-proxy_conf.html#allowed-egress-protocols) option of the ``osh-http-proxy.conf`` file.

A more complete list of changes can be found below, for an exhaustive (and boring) list, please refer to the [commit log](https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/compare/v3.19.00...v3.19.01).
