This is a **release-candidate**.

As several important pull-requests have been merged, we're starting with rc series, which will be tested in the field for a few days. If no regression or blocking bug is found within ~1 week, the next v3.02.00 stable version will be released.
This rc (rc3) is expected to be the last before the release.

The following changes have been done since the previous rc:
- feat: `rootListIngressKeys`: look for all well-known authkeys files
- feat: add `--(in|ex)clude` filters to `groupList` and `accountList`
- enh: `groupList`: use cache to speedup calls
- enh: config: detect `warnBefore`/`idleTimeout` misconfiguration (#125)
- fix: scripts: `(( ))` returns 1 if evaluated to zero, hence failing under `set -e`
- fix: config: be more permissive for `documentationURL` regex
- fix: TOCTTOU fixes in ttyrec rotation script and lingering sessions reaper
- fix: confusing error messages in `groupDelServer`
- chore: tests: also update totalerrors while tests are running
