# :bulb: Highlights

Please read the ``rc1`` changes that are also included in this pre-release.

The ``rc2`` add support of ``rsync`` (#301). Now, for specific protocols (such as scp, sftp and rsync), instead of having a dedicated option for all the plugins, they share a new ``--protocol`` option, which will permit adding more protocols if needed, without requiring adding new named options. The previous options are still supported and will keep working, even if the [documentation](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/using/sftp_scp_rsync.html) has been updated to only reference ``--protocol``.

We also add a new per-account option: egress session multiplexing (usage of the ``ControlPath`` and ``ControlMaster`` ssh client options), for accounts opening a large number of connections to the same hosts, such as is the case with e.g. Ansible usage. You'll find it in the [accountModify](https://ovh.github.io/the-bastion/plugins/restricted/accountModify.html?highlight=multiplexing#cmdoption-accountModify-egress-session-multiplexing) documentation.

Worth noting is also a new plugin: ``groupSetServers``, to permit setting the ACL (asset list) of a group in one shot, to attain a given wanted list, instead of having to rely in several `groupAddServer` and `groupDelServer` calls.
