The basics

This section explains the basics you need to know to work with the bastion.
It's advised to go through all the subsections.

We make the assumption here that you already have a bastion account:

- either you're one of the admins who just :doc:`installed<../../installation/basic>` it, or
- one of the admins created an account for you, using :doc:`/plugins/restricted/accountCreate`
