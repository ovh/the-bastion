The first paragraph of the output lists the different roles along with the people having these roles.

You can also see the public egress key of this group, i.e. the key that needs to be added to the remote servers' ``authorized_keys`` files, so that ``members`` of this group can access these servers.

Note that if you want to see the list of servers pertaining to this group, you can use the command ``groupListServers``.
