bastion.conf reference
======================

.. note::

   The Bastion has a lot of configuration options so that you can tailor it to your needs.
   However, if you're just starting and would like to get started quickly, just configure
   the ``Main Options``. All the other options have sane defaults that can still be customized
   at a later time.
