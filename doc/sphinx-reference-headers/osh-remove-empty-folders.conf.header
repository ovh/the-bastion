.. note::

   The osh-remove-empty-folders script is called by cron and is responsible
   for cleaning up the ``ttyrec/`` directory of users homes, which may contain
   a high amount of empty folders for busy users connecting to a lot of
   different servers, as we create one folder per destination IP.
